/**
 * Fin generation -- M4. The fin stands BESIDE the part on a flat upright face,
 * held off by a standoff, and horizontal tines fuse across that gap into the
 * part. See planes.js for why M3's sweep-under-the-overhang geometry had to be
 * abandoned, and docs/FIN-SPEC.md for where every number below comes from.
 *
 * A fin is three kinds of solid that overlap and get unioned by the slicer -- no
 * boolean kernel anywhere, the same approach the rest of the project uses:
 *   1. the WALL, a thin round-topped blade standing off the part face;
 *   2. the BASE, a wide flat ellipse that keeps the wall stuck to the plate;
 *   3. the TINES, tiny horizontal nubs bridging the standoff into the part.
 *
 * The tines are the point. A wall with only a gap constrains the part in one
 * direction and it falls away sideways -- Slant3D demos a cube doing exactly
 * that mid-print. Tines are what make it a *combined* support.
 *
 * WHY THE TINES ARE HORIZONTAL: a horizontal tine prints as one continuous layer
 * line -- the nozzle runs along the wall, crosses into the part and back out,
 * with no retraction, laying a single strong bead. A vertical tine is its own
 * little tower grown a dot per layer: frail, often never touching the part, and
 * a retraction each. Horizontal tines also lie in the plane of the layer lines,
 * which is what lets you BEND them to snap clean instead of tearing them out.
 *
 * Everything about the wall is built in the patch's frame (planes.js), so a fin
 * serving a leaning face leans with it. The tines are the exception: they are
 * built in world axes, because a tine must occupy ONE layer, and a box that is
 * flat in a leaning frame is not flat in z.

 * Where along the patch to put a fin, and how tall to make it.
 *
 * A patch is flat but the PART is not, so a wall standing off the patch plane
 * can still drive straight through geometry beside it. The fix is not to trim
 * the wall's LENGTH against a globally-tall wall -- that was the previous
 * version and it found nothing.
 *
 * THE THING THAT WAS WRONG: the wall's height came from the patch's bounding
 * box, so every u got a wall as tall as the patch's highest point. On a tilted
 * part the patch is a DIAGONAL BAND in (u, z), so at most u values that wall
 * shot right past the patch into the part's neighbouring faces. Mapping it made
 * it obvious -- two diagonal lines of obstruction running along the patch's
 * edges, together sweeping 92 of 100 bins on the hub. The wall was being blocked
 * by geometry it only reached because it was too tall to begin with.
 *
 * So the height follows the patch LOCALLY. Per bin we know the patch's own top,
 * and the lowest obstruction crossing the wall's slab; a window is valid when
 * its wall -- no taller than the lowest patch top inside it -- clears every
 * obstruction inside it.
 *
 * The window is also capped at `maxLen`, which is docs/FIN-SPEC.md's "place it
 * on an edge or corner, never mid-face" expressed as arithmetic: a fin is a
 * short brace at a corner, not a wall down the whole side of the part.

 * to stick.
 *
 * It is fed the part's lowest VERTICES for its outline (a part standing on an
 * edge has no face on the plate at all, so a face-based footprint is empty in
 * precisely the case the pad exists for) AND the seated part triangles, so its
 * TOP can hold `gap` clear of the part instead of welding to it.
 *
 * THE SHAPE: the first pad was a flat 0.5mm slab, so wherever the part's underside
 * dipped into that band -- which is exactly the resting contact the pad exists for
 * -- the two fused solid (measured 0.46mm of interpenetration on a tilted
 * drive_frame) and would not break off. The pad conforms to the part instead, and
 * (Matthew's ask) it is a clean OVAL rather than a boxy grid: a radial mesh of the
 * contact ellipse -- rings of vertices from the centre out to (r1, r2) -- with each
 * vertex given its own top height. OUTBOARD (no part overhead) rises to the full
 * `padH` for the wide bed grip; under the part it caps at `part_low + grab`, a light
 * tack that connects without the deep weld. The disc is one watertight solid (top
