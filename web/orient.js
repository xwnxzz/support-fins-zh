/**
 * Orientation suggester -- ranked, never auto-applied.
 *
 * The product rule (v1 spec, and the "human stays in the loop" video beat) is
 * that the user rotates; this only proposes. It returns 2-3 candidate poses with
 * their tradeoffs and an honest confidence, and the UI applies one on a click.
 *
 * We score for PRINTABILITY, not strength, on purpose. Strength wants the part
 * tilted onto a slant so the layer lines run diagonally -- but which slant is
 * strongest depends on the load direction, which geometry cannot infer (the
 * spike's four parts each picked a different pose for pull vs. lever). Worse, a
 * strength-first solver is exactly what produced the "155mm tall, balanced on its
 * own needle, two sail-sized fins" pose the spike flagged: geometrically valid,
 * terrible print. So the auto suggester minimises support instead, and the
 * stronger-but-tilted pose is offered only once the user places the load arrow.
 *
 * Cheap first pass over every candidate using analyze() (allocation-free), then
 * the full buildFins() on the few finalists to measure how much of the overhang
 * can actually be finned. Candidates need no convex-hull kernel: a part rests on
 * a flat face, so the large-area normal clusters ARE its stable down-faces.
