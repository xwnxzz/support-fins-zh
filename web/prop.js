/**
 * PROP mode -- a breakaway wall that stands UNDER an overhang.
 *
 * This is a different support from the fin in fins.js, not a variant of it, and
 * the difference is what it leans on:
 *
 *   Stabilize  a wall BESIDE the part, gripping a face with horizontal tines.
 *              Needs a face to grip, so it cannot serve a cone or a sphere.
 *   Prop       a wall UNDER the overhang, rising from the plate and stopping
 *              `gap` short. The part bridges that last layer, so the wall never
 *              fuses and it snaps off. Needs only an underside contact line,
 *              which every shape has.
 *
 * A prop has no tines, deliberately. Tine-less supports were rejected early in
 * this project on Slant3D's demo of a cube falling away from one -- but that is
 * a part balanced on an EDGE with the support as its only restraint. A part
 * sitting down on the plate with an overhang above it has no such failure mode:
 * gravity holds it onto the prop. `tools/support/breakaway.py` in the video repo
 * works exactly this way, has no tines anywhere in it, and produced good fins on
 * real printed shelter hubs -- the parts Stabilize could not touch.
 *
 * The geometry is M3's, which was validated (34/36 regions served, every wall
 * watertight) and then retired for the wrong reason. What is new here is the
 * judgement around it: a prop is only emitted where the wall can actually reach
 * the plate through open air.

  // --- TINES (the grip comb) ---------------------------------------------
  // A plain prop stops `gap` under the overhang and the part bridges over it:
  // a pure breakaway, no grip. The COMBINED support adds a comb of tiny
  // horizontal nubs along the wall's top that bite a hair into the part, so a
  // tilted part cannot peel or twist off the wall -- and, because each nub is
  // one layer line lying in the layer plane, it BENDS to snap clean instead of
  // tearing out (fins.js documents the same reasoning for the beside-the-face
  // fin these replace). Tines only bite where the overhang is steep enough that
  // a horizontal poke reaches solid: past a slope of gap/bite the nub lands in
  // the part, below it in air, and the emitter simply skips the ones that miss
  // (verified by insidePart, never assumed) -- the same honest behaviour the
  // beside-the-face fin had.
  // A tine must be exactly ONE layer tall: printed that way it lays down as a
  // single continuous bead (the nozzle runs along the wall, into the part, back
  // out -- no retraction), which is the whole reason it fuses AND snaps off clean
  // (FIN-SPEC.md "Why the tines must be horizontal"). One layer means one SLICER
  // layer, so this has to equal the print's layer height -- 0.3 (Slant3D's number,

  // 0.4-0.8mm (0.4 = one nozzle pass, 0.8 = out-and-back), "as small as possible".

  // on the face", and the cube bed-release it was meant to cure was the pad's
  // fault, not the tines'. Surface marking from the dense comb is now tamed the
  // deliberate way: the user's "Tine grip" slider (tineStepFor / opts.tineDensity),
  // which DEFAULTS to dense and the minGripTines floor still protects -- never by
  // silently starving grip. Pinned by tests/tine_density.test.js.

  // flat middle -- that mid-face march is what left Matthew's bracket "marked
  // everywhere". So the comb runs DENSE within a band at each end of a wall's run
  // (the run's ends sit on the overhang's edges/corners, where the marks hide and
  // where anti-peel/twist grip has the longest moment arm anyway) and THINS across
  // the middle by tineMidFactor. Short walls (run <= 2*band) are all-edge, so they
  // stay dense end-to-end and the minGripTines floor is untouched.

//     so anything shorter than 2 x footMin is a nub that cannot stand on its own foot.
// It stays ABSOLUTE (mm) on purpose: the floor is about whether the SUPPORT is worth
// printing, not about the part's size. A part whose rim strip is under this gets no
// support because none would be meaningful (its overhang band is shallower than a
// nozzle pass), while a large round part's strip is deep enough for the ordinary
// `minSpan` path. tests/round_boundary.test.js pins R = 2 .. 100 at four mesh

/**
 * Split one overhang region into locally-straight sub-patches.
 *
 * A connected overhang region is a topological artifact, not a support unit:
 * union-find in overhangs.js merges the entire tilted underside of
 * voron_drive_frame into one 3,240 mm2 region whose contact line sits 6.4 mm RMS
 * off any straight axis, so the straightness gate -- correctly -- refuses to
 * sweep a wall along it, and the region's genuinely straight ledges are refused
 * with it. The unit a wall wants is the locally-flat piece.
 *
 * Split the FACES, never the polyline: `contactLine` fits ONE principal axis to
 * whatever it is given, so for an L-shaped or wrapped region the polyline is
 * already wrong before any split could rescue it.
 *
 * Region-grow from a seed face, judging every candidate against the SEED's
 * normal, never its neighbour's. planes.js documents why pairwise agreement is
 * wrong: it creeps -- a cylinder's faces each differ from the next by a few
 * degrees, so the whole cylinder merges into one "flat" patch. Growing against
 * the seed cannot creep, because the hundredth face is judged by the same
 * reference as the first. The cutoff is tighter than planes.js's 35 degrees
 * because the jobs differ: a wall patch only has to keep facing the fin, while a
 * sub-patch here has to yield a contact line straight enough for `straightness`
 * (0.10 RMS/chord) -- a band of underside curving more than ~15 degrees each way
 * already bows past that.
 *
 * Seeds are taken largest-face-first, so the flattest expanse defines each

/**
 * The contact polylines for one locally-flat sub-patch: straight parallel
 * tracks sampled on the patch's own surface, spaced maxUnsupportedSpan apart,
 * split wherever the patch does not cover them.
 *
 * This replaces per-bucket lowest-point selection (`contactLine`) for
 * sub-patches, because on the patches splitRegion produces, that selection is
 * unsound three different ways -- all measured on the dev matrix:
 *
 *   - On a WIDE tilted plane the lowest point per slice alternates between the
 *     downhill edge and pocket rims 26mm away; the polyline zigzags (34 reversals
 *     on voron_drive_frame @25) yet PASSES the RMS/chord gate, because 6mm of
 *     wobble is small against a 115mm chord. The sweep then self-intersects:
 *     134 bodies, one with negative volume.
 *   - On a FLAT ledge every point ties for lowest, so the pick is arbitrary and
 *     the "line" reads 0.103 -- voron_filter_housing @0's one servable ledge,
 *     refused on tie-breaking noise.
 *   - On a COARSE mesh a 169mm2 patch can be a single triangle: four points
 *     cannot be bucketed into a track at all.
 *
 * Tracks run along the patch's principal HORIZONTAL axis -- the same axis
 * contactLine fits, and the direction the owner's sketch draws: on a frame
 * whose underside slopes along its length, the principal axis IS the slope, and
 * the wall's top climbs with it. (A first version ran tracks along the mean

/**
 * How far the contact polyline strays from the straight line through it: RMS
 * perpendicular deviation from the best-fit axis, over the chord it spans.
 * 0 is a perfectly straight run; a ring reads ~0.2.
 *
 * THIS IS A PRECONDITION, NOT A QUALITY SCORE. `breakaway.py` says so in its own
 * docstring -- "the contact line is assumed ~straight (a linear overhang)" --
 * and the port inherited the sweep without inheriting the assumption. When the
 * overhang is a BOWL rather than a ledge (the underside of a ball hub, a cone, a
 * sphere) its lowest points form a ring, not a line. `contactLine` then fits a
 * principal axis to an isotropic point set, which is noise, and buckets along
 * it -- so the "line" alternates between the two sides of the ring and the swept
 * wall saws through the part.
 *
 * WHY NOT ARC LENGTH / CHORD, which is what this used to be. Arc length grows
 * without bound as you sample a curve more finely; the chord does not. So
 * "tortuosity" measured the SAMPLING, not the shape, and the 2.0 gate flipped on
 * a perfectly good region as soon as anyone densified the stations. Measured on
 * voron_drive_frame at 40 degrees, one region, varying only the station count:
 *
 *   stations      8      14     24     48     96
 *   arc/chord     1.14   1.44   1.59   2.08   3.16   <- crosses the gate
 *   THIS          0.081  0.069  0.062  0.065  0.065  <- flat
 *
 * That is why fixing this had to come BEFORE `stationStep`: densifying first
 * regressed the drive frame from one good wall to none.
 *
 * The 0.10 threshold sits in the measured gap between the two populations:
 * servable ledges land at 0.06-0.08, and hub_post_foot's ball-hub bowl -- the
 * case the gate exists for -- at 0.15-0.21. Note that a LOW score is not a
 * promise of a good wall: it is only the precondition for a swept wall meaning
 * anything at all.

/**
 * Lower each station until the wall's whole TOP FACE clears the part, not just
 * its centreline.
 *
 * The top is a `tip`-wide flat, and the gap used to be set at the centre of it.
 * On a sloped underside the up-slope corner therefore rises by
 * `half_tip x slope` INTO the gap -- and past a slope of `gap / half_tip`, which
 * is only `atan(0.2 / 0.3)` = 33.7 degrees from horizontal, straight into the
 * part. Most overhang surfaces are steeper than that.
 *
 * This was on record as an imprecision to tidy up later ("0.11-0.19mm where 0.2
 * was intended", one wall measuring 0.009mm, which is a weld). It is not a
 * precision problem, it is the main reason walls were being discarded outright:
 * `insidePart` sees the buried corner and `buildProps` throws the whole solid
 * away as `buried`. Measured across four failing cases, the buried vertices at
 * foot height numbered 0 of 5, 0 of 10, 0 of 23 and 0 of 29 -- every one of them
 * was at the wall's top.
 *
 * So evaluate the surface at BOTH TIP CORNERS as well as the centre, and take
 * the lowest. That makes `gap` a floor instead of an average.
 *
 * ACROSS the tip only, never ALONG the run. Sampling along the run as well was
 * tried and is wrong twice over: the top edge already interpolates linearly
 * between stations, and the sag that creates is already pulled down by the
 * midpoint pass in `contactLine`. Taking an along-run minimum on top of that
 * double-counts the slope -- measured, it opened gaps to 0.32-0.34mm on sloped
 * undersides and 2.4mm where the underside has a step, which is a wall the part
 * never lands on. The tip is 0.6mm wide; that is the only distance this pass is
 * responsible for.

 * Build brimmed squat breakaway walls on the sub-minHeight bed stations of a

 *
 * A flanged wall needs ~minHeight of headroom to exist at all, so `sweep` and its
 * trim discard every station lower than that; on an organic part whose underside
 * ramps down to the plate, that abandons the whole low band and it prints into
 * air. Here the low band is built directly: the stations with minHeightSquat <=
 * height < minHeight (DISJOINT from the tall run the caller builds, so the two
 * never compete) are walked into maximal runs, and each is swept via `sweepSquat`
 * -- a thin wall on a thin WIDE brim. The full T-foot can't fit under a 1mm wall
 * (footMin 1.6 would splay into a sheet), but the wall still has to HOLD to the
 * plate, so the brim gives it the adhesion area a bare 0.6mm-wide tip never could.
 * Same weld guard as the plate path: a squat wall that would fuse is dropped,
 * never shipped ("no prop" is fixable, a fused prop is a ruined print).
 *
 * Operates on a private deep copy of the line so `settleTop` never mutates the
 * points the caller's tall path still reads. Appends triangles to `out` and
 * returns the placed prop descriptors (marked `squat: true`).
