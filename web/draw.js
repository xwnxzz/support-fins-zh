 * DRAW MODE -- the user hands the tool one contact line and it sweeps ONE
 * breakaway wall along it.
 *
 * This is exactly how tools/support/breakaway.py works in the video repo: a
 * human places one wall per feature, so the wall's contact line is GIVEN, never
 * guessed. That is the whole reason breakaway.py's output was always cleaner than
 * the auto-placer's -- the sweep was never the fragile part, GUESSING a contact
 * line for a 2D overhang region was. On a square face the auto-placer fit a PCA
 * axis to a near-isotropic footprint and the eigenvector snapped to ~45deg, so
 * the walls ran diagonally across the face and self-intersected. A line the user
 * draws is straight in XY by construction; there is nothing left to snap.
 *
 * Geometry only. The interaction (picking the two endpoints, live preview, undo)
 * lives in app.js; this module turns two surface points plus the part's triangles
 * into a watertight wall, reusing prop.js's proven `sweep` and its three
 * line-settling passes verbatim.
