# Support Fins

**Tip a part on edge, and Support Fins adds the breakaway support fins that make that
orientation printable — baked right into the STL.**

Live at **[printfins.com](https://printfins.com)**. Runs entirely in your browser: nothing
uploads, nothing installs, no account.

## Why

Printing a part flat is usually the weakest way to print it. Lying or diagonal layer
orientation tests up to ~3× stronger than standing up. Most people print flat anyway,
because the strong orientation needs supports, and slicer supports scar the surface, waste
plastic, and take longer to pick off than the part took to design.

Designed-in fins fix that, and they beat slicer supports in one way a slicer can't touch:
the support lives in the STL. Upload it anywhere — any printer, any filament, any slicer —
and it still comes out right. A slicer only ever outputs gcode for one machine.

No slicer generates these. OrcaSlicer's whole style list is Grid / Snug / Organic / Tree
Slim / Strong / Hybrid, and none of them modify the mesh or bond to the part on purpose.
The technique isn't new (Slant3D has evangelized designed-in supports for years), but until
now you had to CAD it by hand every time.

## How it works

1. Load an STL or 3MF.
2. Rotate it. You're in control — Support Fins suggests, it never decides for you.
3. It shows you live: overhang count, how many can take a real fin, height, bed contact.
   Point at the load direction, answer one question — *does it pull apart, or does it
   lever?* — and it scores orientations for strength too.
4. Export. Fins and a bed pad come baked into the STL (or 3MF).

**Why you pick the rotation, not the software:** "stronger" means nothing without a load
direction, and the geometry doesn't contain one. Turn a solver fully loose and it'll hand
you a part 155 mm tall balanced on a needle with two sail-sized fins — technically optimal,
completely unprintable. (Ours did exactly that.) So the human makes the one call the
software can't, and the software does the rest.

## Status

The web app is live and does the full loop: load, rotate, score, fin, export. The geometry
engine is validated against third-party STLs and pinned by an offline test suite.

Working: overhang detection, bed-reachability, contoured breakaway fin walls, orientation +
load-direction scoring, the combined fin (wall + tines that fuse into the part — the whole
point; see `docs/FIN-SPEC.md`), STL and 3MF import, STL and 3MF export.

Still open: scale-aware fin profiles, and the bed pad on tilted exports.

### The "no config, geometry only" notice

Opening the 3MF, **Bambu Studio** ("invalid config, load geometry data only") and
**PrusaSlicer** ("does not contain PrusaSlicer configuration. Only geometry was
loaded.") show a notice and import just the mesh. This is **expected and harmless** —
every slicer shows it for any geometry-only 3MF (Fusion 360, FreeCAD, even the 3MF
Consortium's own reference files). The part imports correctly oriented and sized; the
fins come in as intended. Just slice with supports off. (OrcaSlicer opens it without a
notice.)

The export ships **pure geometry with no slicer profile embedded** on purpose: baking
in a profile would silence the notice but replace whoever-opens-it's printer/filament/
print settings with ours on load, and it would have to be re-authored per slicer *and*
per slicer version — a worse trade than a one-time, benign notice on a file whose
geometry is already right. See `web/threemf.js` for the writer.

## Run it locally

The web app is vanilla ES modules — no build step. Serve it with the included dev server
(it disables caching so edits actually show up on reload):

```bash
python3 dev-server.py                      # http://localhost:8731/
python3 dev-server.py 8080                 # custom port
python3 dev-server.py --host 0.0.0.0       # reach from other devices on the LAN
```

By default the server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). Pass `--host 0.0.0.0`
to expose it to the local network — handy on a headless box like a Raspberry Pi
behind a firewall; the script prints the LAN address to open. The port is an
optional positional argument and `--help` lists every option.

Or run the same `web/` directory in Docker — nginx on the host's 8731, so the URL
is identical to the dev server:

```bash
docker compose up --build        # http://localhost:8731/
```

There's no build step and no backend, so the image is just `nginx:stable-alpine`
serving static files with cache headers that match the dev server. See
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile), and
[`nginx.conf`](nginx.conf).

The Python prototype is the proof of concept the engine was ported from — plain mesh math,
no CAD kernel:

```bash
pip install trimesh numpy manifold3d
python3 prototype/spike_overhangs.py yourpart.stl      # what needs support
python3 prototype/spike_fins.py yourpart.stl out.stl   # add fins
python3 prototype/spike_orient.py yourpart.stl         # rank orientations
python3 prototype/spike_arrow.py yourpart.stl 0,0,-1   # load-direction scoring
```

Tests (Deno for the JS engine):

```bash
deno test --allow-read tests/
```

## The PrusaSlicer plugin (exploratory — not currently working)

**Status: exploratory. This does not currently work — treat it as a research spike, not a
usable feature.** `plugin/` is an in-progress attempt at a native PrusaSlicer 3.0 companion.
It can't do the automatic tool — the 3.0 plugin sandbox can't read a loaded mesh's triangles
— and the intended fallback (generating the fin natively: an overhang test object, a
standalone breakaway fin you position by hand, and a combined tine demo) is not functional
yet. Kept in the repo for reference only. Use the browser app instead. See `plugin/README.md`.

## Honest limitations

- Overhangs sitting over the *part* rather than the plate aren't handled — fins attach to
  the bed only.
- Features shorter than roughly a 4 mm wall height are too short for a real fin.
- It won't pick your orientation for you. On purpose.

## Layout

```
web/         the browser app (live at printfins.com)
plugin/      native PrusaSlicer 3.0 plugin (exploratory — not working)
prototype/   Python/trimesh proof of concept the engine was ported from
docs/        FIN-SPEC.md — the verified fin geometry, with sources
tests/       offline geometry regression suite
```

Fins are separate closed solids appended to the mesh; the slicer unions them. The whole
engine is plain mesh math with no boolean kernel, because it has to run in the browser.

## Credit

The fin technique is Slant3D's — they've evangelized designed-in supports for years.
Support Fins just automates it. `docs/FIN-SPEC.md` cites their numbers directly.

## License

Fins are entirely yours, and the output carries no license obligation.
